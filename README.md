### About the Project

This project explores the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem and its applications in anomaly detection across biological datasets. We implement three Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants: Pairwise Frank-Wolfe, Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradient (BPCG), and a (1+œµ)-approximation using Away-Steps. These methods are evaluated for computational efficiency, convergence rates, and anomaly detection performance in biological contexts.

### Key Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of anomalies in biological datasets.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Implementation of three Frank-Wolfe-based algorithms, each offering unique advantages in convergence and computational performance.
- **Biological Data Application**: Practical application in detecting anomalies in datasets like breast cancer, gene expression, vertebral pathology, and maternity risk.

### Key Results

- **Convergence**: All three algorithms demonstrated linear convergence on the MEB problem.
- **Best Performance**: The (1+œµ)-approximation (Yildirim 2008) showed superior computational performance, especially on high-dimensional datasets.
- **Recall Metrics**: Focused on recall as the benchmark for anomaly detection, achieving optimal recall values for most datasets.

### Data Overview

This study uses four biological datasets focused on anomaly detection. Links to each dataset:

- **Breast Cancer**: [Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
- **Breast Cancer Gene Expression**: [Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq)
- **Vertebral Column Pathology**: [Vertebral Column Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/212/vertebral+column)
- **Maternity Risk**: [Maternity Risk Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk)

### Methodology

We apply three variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve the MEB problem:

- **Pairwise Frank-Wolfe**: An efficient, projection-free algorithm.
- **Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG)**: An optimized variant that minimizes swap steps.
- **(1+œµ)-Approximation with Away-Steps**: An approximation method designed for efficient handling of large datasets.

Each algorithm is evaluated on convergence rates, computational time, and accuracy metrics (primarily recall) in detecting anomalies.
